TODO:

// GENERAL //
-> Look into allowing swiping left/right to navigate between tabs (this could replace or augment the clickable buttons if it works well!)
-> Email view -> Need to establish pop3 account access? look at gmail widget for ideas about how to do this

-> Lockscreen widget? 4.2 supports this..could be fun


// STYLE - LAYOUT //
-> Make the widget more transparent -> Look at alpha values for drawable backgrounds
-> Its pretty ugly right now...
-> Replace Tab text with icons. I think 2 icons per tab should suffice - A 'dark' one when the tab is not selective and a 'lit' one for when it's currently active.


// SMS //
-> Use a conversation list approach instead of listing all individual messages?
-> Get outbound messages


// PHONE //
-> New layout - mimic the actual call log interface - Distinguish between incoming/outbound/missed..etc
