TODO:

// GENERAL //
-> Look into allowing swiping left/right to navigate between tabs (this could replace or augment the clickable buttons if it works well!)
-> Email view -> Need to establish pop3 account access? look at gmail widget for ideas about how to do this

-> Lockscreen widget? 4.2 supports this..could be fun

// TABS //
-> Implement a notepad activity (Basic tutorial should suffice) to allow notes to be added edited.
-> Figure out how to pull emails and store in a local database
-> Web activity needs to be improved -> List activity similar to the notes list


// STYLE - LAYOUT //
-> Need icons for:
                Notes
                Email
                Web
                *Alarm/Calendar (Todo)
-> Currently with a dark background it's almost TOO transparent
-> Size needs to be adjusted
-> Make text/icons bigger? The emulator seems pretty good, but its too small on
   the actual device


// SMS //
-> Use a conversation list approach instead of listing all individual messages?
-> Get outbound messages?


// PHONE //
-> Clean up the layout: Phone number format, direction image size


// LONG TERM //
-> Dynamic tabs - Allow them to be added, removed, repositioned. (Use an activity for this?)
-> Custom OS build -> Lock widget to the homescreen
